# Lamp Control Website Specification

## Purpose
Create a web interface that allows users to control a physical lamp remotely using the LIFX API.

## Core Features

1. **Power Control**
   - Toggle the lamp on or off.

2. **Brightness Adjustment**
   - Slider or input to set the lamp's brightness (0â€“100%).

3. **Color Selection**
   - Color picker for custom colors (if supported by the lamp).
   - Preset color buttons (e.g., red, green, blue, white).

4. **Status Display**
   - Show the current state of the lamp (on/off, brightness, color).

5. **API Integration**
   - All controls send requests to the LIFX API.
   - Handle API errors and provide user feedback.

6. **Responsive UI**
   - Interface should be usable on both desktop and mobile devices.

7. **(Optional) Authentication**
   - Restrict access to authorized users if needed.

## User Flow
- User visits the website.
- The current lamp status is displayed.
- User can toggle power, adjust brightness, or change color.
- Each action sends a request to the LIFX API and updates the UI accordingly.

## Technical Notes
- **Frontend:** React (or similar), using fetch/axios for API calls.
- **Backend:** Not required unless proxying or securing API requests.
- **API:** Use endpoints and authentication as defined in the [LIFX API documentation](./lifx-api.md).

## Next Steps
- Review the LIFX API documentation for endpoint details and authentication.
- Design wireframes for the UI.
- Implement frontend components and connect to the API.
